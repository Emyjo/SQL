In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables to answer questions about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderid

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product,
price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue,
product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(quantity),

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity > 2

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. 
SELECT product,

WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY product
